# prometheus-explorer

Interactively explore metrics, create shortcuts for common metrics and
reference existing visualizations.

This is not intended to replace Grafana or Prometheus' graph explorer,
but to exist between them, for on-the-fly exploration and referencing of
metrics that belong to many different services or boards.
